# Next.js Starter by Progressandro

This starter includes the following toolkit (which for now is an exact replica of the starter made in [this](https://dev.to/joshchu/how-to-setup-prettier-eslint-husky-and-lint-staged-with-a-nextjs-and-typescript-project-i7b) awesome post, but I'll probably keep adding stuff later):

- Next.js: Full-stack framework.
- ESLint: Linting.
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`: An ESLint plugin which provides lint rules for TypeScript codebases.
  - `eslint-config-airbnb`: This package provides Airbnb's .eslintrc as an extensible shared config.
  - `eslint-config-prettier`: Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with [Prettier].
  - `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`: Static AST checker for accessibility rules on JSX elements.
  - `eslint-plugin-prettier`: Runs Prettier as an ESLint rule and reports differences as individual ESLint issues.
  - `eslint-plugin-react`: React specific linting rules for eslint.
  - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`: This ESLint plugin enforces the Rules of Hooks.
  - `eslint-plugin-security`: ESLint rules for Node Security.
  - `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`: Easy autofixable import sorting.
  - `eslint-plugin-sonarjs`: SonarJS rules for ESLint to detect bugs and suspicious patterns in your code.
- Prettier: Code formatting.
- Lint-staged: Lint only what you're gonna commit.
